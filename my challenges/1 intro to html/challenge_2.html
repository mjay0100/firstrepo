        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0.<strong> Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.</strong><br>
        <em>Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike</em>. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to <strong>learn.</strong><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        <strong>Until one day</strong>, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One <em>idea</em> on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger</strong>.<br>
        Failing is just another word for <strong>growing</strong>. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. <em>learning</em>.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
       <strong> You just don’t get it, yet.</strong>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <em>basic ideas </em>that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn <strong>anything.</strong>
