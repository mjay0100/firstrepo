        <p >The <em>dogs,</em> are sometimes referred to as <strong>"man's best friend"</strong> because they are kept as domestic pets and are usually<em> loyal</em> and like being around humans. Dogs like to be petted, but only when they can first see the petter's hand before petting; one should never pet a dog from behind. They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans.</p>
